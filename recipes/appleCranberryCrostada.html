                    <p>While a good pie crust ought to be a part of every cook's repertoire, 
                        sometimes there just isn't the time. But why leave the baking to the grocery stores or bakery when 
                        puff pastry is a simple, high-quality stand-in for the original? In this Crostada, the sheet dough 
                        is baked free-form with ingredients piled on top. Couldn't be easier!

            <h3 class="header3">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm, crisp apples), peeled, quartered, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
                <li>1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked), peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
                <li>½ cup sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup dried cranberries</li>
                <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold (follow package directions)</li>
                <li>1 egg white, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="header3">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; 
                    cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, 
                    stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, 
                    about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room 
                    temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)
                </p>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. 
                    Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. 
                    Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. 
                    (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't 
                    stick and allows easy cleanup.)
                </p>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">
                    Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. 
                    Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. 
                    Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. 
                    sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. 
                    Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream.
