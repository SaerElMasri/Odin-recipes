                <p style="font-size:15px;">The inspiration for this pie came from a very unlikely source: soup! 
                    After having an incredible savory pumpkin-tahini soup, 
                    I became obsessed with this flavor combination. 
                    It was all the things: nutty, toasty, creamy, earthy, and just so delicious.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    But how would that flavor combo hold up in a dessert? 
                    Especially one as classic as pumpkin pie? Would it work? I mean: 
                    If pumpkin can dual-wield in both sweet and savory dishes, why can't tahini?
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    After some trial and error in the kitchen, I discovered that the answer to this is, in fact, a resounding yes! 
                    It was all about finding the right amount of tahini vs. pumpkin vs. spice and sweetness in order to not have one ingredient overpower the other. 
                    The end result was a pie that was perfectly balanced in both flavor and texture.

            <h3 class="header3">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
                <li>¼ cup tahini</li>
                <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="header3">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">Place prepared pie crust onto a baking sheet.</p>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">In a bowl, whisk together pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, 
                    tahini, heavy cream, vanilla, and salt until smooth and combined.
                    Pour into prepared pie crust.
                </p>
                <li>Step 4</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">
                    Place pan into oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temp to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 
                    and continue baking until pie is set but the middle is still slightly jiggly, 30 to 35 minutes. 
                    Remove from the oven and allow pie to cool completely, at least 4 hours.
                </p>
                <li>Step 5</li>
                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;">
                    If desired, garnish with toasted sesame seeds before serving.
                </p>
